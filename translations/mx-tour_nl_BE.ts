You have probably noticed that the default desktop of MX Linux has a single vertical panel on the left side of the screen.  

This may be very different to what you are used to, but it saves screen space for your applications, and it can become very natural after a short amount of time.

Panel orientation is easily changeable in MX Tools &gt; MX Tweak.

Even more options to customize your panel exist under Settings Manager &gt; Panel

Lets explore some of the key components of the panel from top to bottom:

(1) Power Button which opens a window to:
    • Log Out
    • Restart
    • Shutdown
    • Suspend

(2) Clock (Date Time)
    • Left-Click to open a calendar
    • Right-Click to change the properties

(3) Docklike Taskbar (Application Switcher)
    • Firefox browser
    • Thunar File Manager

(4) Notification Area consists of (from top to bottom)
    • Volume manager
    • USB ejector
    • Clipboard manager
    • Network manager
    • Update manager
    • Power manager

It consists of five main areas:
(1) Favorites Quick Links
(2) Recent Applications and Files
(3) Application Categories
(4) Search bar
(5) System Quick Links

You can open the Application Menu by Left-Clicking on it or pressing the &quot;Windows&quot; key on your keyboard.

You can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the categories on the side.

Favorites are easy to add, reorder, and remove by Right-Clicking on any application and select “Add to Favorites”. Simply drag and drop your favorites list to arrange them.

If you’re not sure exactly where a program is listed, the search field is automatically focused when opening the menu, so you can just search by application name or general words such as &quot;browser&quot;.

You can edit the Application Menu properties by Right-Clicking on it.

        <source>Docklike Taskbar is a lightweight, modern, and minimalist application taskbar that sits in the panel below the clock.  It starts with Firefox browser and Thunar File Manager pinned on it.

A few things to know about Docklike Taskbar are that you can:

(1) &quot;Pin&quot; an open application by Right-Clicking and checking &quot;Pin to Dock&quot;
(2) Customize the look and feel by Right-Clicking between two icons and selecting (3) Properties

It consists of:
(1) MX Tools
(2) MX Fluxbox User Manual
(3) MX Fluxbox Videos

The default dock can easily be modified using MX Dockmaker; furthermore, it can be placed on auto-hide or cancelled completely using the root Menu &gt; Out of Sight.

Another dock option is available using tint2 (the software behind the panel), which makes much greater customization possible. Two tint2 dock configurations can be found using the root Menu &gt; Appearance &gt; Dock.

You can access MX Welcome again by finding it in the main Main Application Menu or by opening MX Tools.

You can use the 'Show this dialog at start up' checkbox (as shown above) if you would like to see MX Welcome each time your system starts and uncheck it when you no longer need it.

It consists of Tabs to help you install &quot;Popular Applications&quot; and any package in the MX/Debian Stable, the MX Test, Debian Backports, and Flatpak repositories.

The Popular Applications tab is organized by categories for easy searching and install.

The MX Test Repo tab is a safe and effective way to install new incoming applications that are waiting to be moved to the MX Stable repositories.

The Search function located in the upper right can help you locate applications easier.

It is a KDE native application so it also allows you to install KDE application and Plasma Add-ons such as widgets and extensions.

Discover may be considered more user friendly for new users but it is not configured for One Click installs from the MX &quot;Popular Applications&quot;, the MX Test, Debian Backports, and Flatpak repositories.  For these you should use MX Package Installer.

Using MX Live USB Maker, you can write the ISO file USB to use as a recovery method or to install on other systems.

Two types of Snapshot ISO files can be created:
• “Personal Snapshot” - saves almost everything, used to backup current system, and personal files
• “System Snapshot” - with apps you installed and without ones you removed, and no personal files

        <source>Timeshift is an application that provides functionality similar to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file system and settings at scheduled intervals. These snapshots can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system.

When you open Timeshift the first time, a Setup Wizard will run allowing you to select the location snapshots are saved to, the schedule, and if you want to include personal files or not.  You can rerun the Setup Wizard or change these settings at any time.

User files such as documents, pictures and music are excluded by default. This ensures that your personal files remain unchanged when you restore your system to an earlier date.

ATTENTION!
• Pay attention to the Snapshot schedule and disk space.  You can uncheck all boxes to make only on demand snapshots.
• Timeshift is NOT a backup tool, for full system backups please use MX Snapshot or luckyBackup.

The output is automatically copied to the clipboard, it can also be pasted directly into a MX Forum post complete with code tags, or pasted into a Text document for use later.

It is important to include your QSI when asking for help on the MX Forum so that the MX Community can better help you.  

QSI automatically filters potentially sensitive information such as personal identifiers, showing it instead as &quot;&lt;filter&gt;&quot;.

(1) Appfinder (Application Menu)

(2) Settings Manager
(3) Thunar File Manager
(4) Web Browser

(5) Notification Area consisting of:
    • Update manager
    • Network manager
    • Sound manager
    • Clipboard manager

(6) Clock (Date Time)
    • Left-Click to open a calendar, Escape (Esc) to close
    • Right-Click to set a alarm
    
(7) Power Button which opens a window to:
    • Lock • Log Out • Restart • Shutdown • Suspend

Even more options to customize your panel exist under Settings Manager &gt; Tint2 Manager, where many other templates are available.

        <source>There are three very different application finders in MXFB, providing the user with choice of which to retain and use.

1. The Applications Menu (&quot;Rofi Appfinder&quot;) is opened by Left-Clicking on the MX logo in the Panel. It consists of three main areas:

(1) Search Bar at the top
(2) Tabs on the left side for Applications, Categories and Help 
(3) Tab details on the right side

The search field is automatically focused when opening the menu, so you can just search by application name or general words such as &quot;browser&quot;. To open an application, Click on your selection or press Return. You can edit the menu behavior and appearance using the contents of the Help tab.

(Appfinder is built using &quot;rofi,&quot; a very flexible and fast app with many applications that can be launched by pressing the logo or super key. Its settings are available in a separate app &quot;Rofi Manager&quot; that includes a large selection of possible templates.)

2. A second applications menu (the &quot;rootMenu&quot;) is revealed by a right-click on the desktop and is a legacy of the original Fluxbox. It is a static and very rapid menu of common applications, settings and actions that can easily be edited by the user. 

3. Included at the top of that rootMenu, finally, is a third application finder called &quot;All Apps.&quot; It is similar in structure and behavior to a typical Debian menu, and updates automatically.

        <source>You may have wondered about the Clock in the upper right corner of your screen, it is a Conky.

Conky is a light-weight system monitor that can display any kind of information on your desktop, either as text, or using simple progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colors.

It can display the status of the CPU, memory, disk storage, temperatures, network interfaces, battery power, e-mail inboxes, many popular music players, weather updates, news feeds, and much more.

MX Linux comes with many different Conkies to choose from or edit.

MX Linux comes with two tools for Conky:
• Conky Toggle - to easily turn Conky off or on
• MX Conky - utility for managing, editing and viewing Conky configuration files
