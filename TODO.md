# TODO

+ Correct and finalize Internationalization of everything (I think I broke it a bit)
+ Fix window-icon not working
+ Complete out MX-KDE Tour tabs (systray, etc)
+ Complete out MXFB Tour tabs (systray, etc)
+ Refine current text dialogs to a final product
+ Refine images a bit more
+ Identify if YAD is supposed to spawn processes for each Notebook tab, fix if not
+ Get Previous and Next buttons to go up and down Tabs - on hold for now
+ Pressing LEFT and RIGHT arrows instead of UP and DOWN arrows hangs the app?
+ Identify if using --picture can actually function how --image is working now to maybe better organize and structure tab dialogs

## Completed
+ Add more Tabs for other MX Tools and other features - no more tabs will be added until user feedback
+ Add links to MX wiki and MX Manual entries within text dialogs
