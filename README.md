This is a placeholder branch for a complete refactoring of the Proof of Concept MX Linux 21 Tour Guide application created using only Yet Another Dialog (YAD).

It should not be expected to be anything more than a non-working mess.  :P

# About MX Tour

Take a tour of MX Linux 21 Xfce and KDE editions.

Using a new Operating System for the first time can seem challenging and scary.

MX Tour is designed to quickly introduce and orient you to many of the features and graphical tools of the different Desktop Editions of MX Linux (Xfce, KDE, and Fluxbox).
