MX Tweak brings together many small but often used customizations organized under different Tabs.

Tabs Overview:
 • Fluxbox - change Dock, Menu, Desktop Icon, and Toolbar settings; Reset to defaults
 • Other - enable internal drive mount options, reset login screen, switch administrative account

Note: Some "tweaks" may not always appear, as they are desktop environment and hardware dependent.
