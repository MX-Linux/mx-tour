You've probably noticed that the default desktop of MX Linux has a single vertical panel on the left side of the screen.  

This may be very different to what you are normally used to, but it saves screen space for your applications, and it can become very natural after a short amount of time.

The panel orientation is easily changeable in MX Tools > MX Tweak.

Even more options to customize your panel exist under Settings Manager > Panel

Lets explore some of the key components of the panel.
