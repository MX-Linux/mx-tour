You may have wondered about the Clock in the upper right corner of your screen, its a Conky.

Conky is a light-weight system monitor that can display any kind of information on your desktop, either as text, or using simple progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colors.

It can display the status of the CPU, memory, disk storage, temperatures, network interfaces, battery power, e-mail inboxes, many popular music players, weather updates, news feeds, and much more.

MX Linux comes with many different Conkies to choose from or edit.

MX Linux comes with three tools for Conky:
• Conky Toggle - to easily turn Conky off or on
• MX Conky - enables detailed changes to the actively running Conky
• Conky Manager - utility for managing and viewing Conky configuration files
