Quick System Info, also known as QSI, is a great and easy way to get a lot of information about your computer hardware and MX Linux installation.

The output is automatically copied to the clipboard, it can also be pasted directly into a MX Forum post complete with code tags, or pasted into a Text document for use later.

It is important to include your QSI when asking for help on the MX Forum so that the MX Community can better help you.  

QSI automatically filters potentially sensitive information like personal identifiers. This information will instead show as "<filter>" in the report.
