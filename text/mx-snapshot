MX Snapshot allows you to create a bootable live-CD/DVD ISO of your currently running MX Linux or antiX system/installation.

The bootable live-CD/DVD ISO can be used as a recovery method or to install on other systems.

Two types of Snapshot ISOs can be created:
“Personal Snapshot” - saves almost everything, used to backup your current system, and personal files
“System Snapshot” - with apps you installed and without ones you removed, and no personal files
