MX Snapshot allows you to create a bootable live-CD/DVD ISO of your currently running MX Linux or antiX system/installation.

Two types of Snapshot ISOs can be created:
“Personal Snapshot” - saves pretty much everything, used if you want to backup your current system including /home
“System Snapshot” - with all the apps you installed and without all the apps you removed, but without anything in /home.
